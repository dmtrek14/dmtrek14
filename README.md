# Live Long and Prosper :vulcan_salute:
I'm Danielle! I am a software developer with a passion for building accessible and well-designed applications. I'm mostly self-taught aside from a couple courses in grad school, and have otherwise learned on the job. HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS were my first languages back in the (gulp) late 90s (though, I have a hazy memory of learning some Basic in elementary school). I've since picked up C# and the .NET ecosystem, SQL, scrappy React and ES6, enough ColdFusion to make a mess of things, and sprinkles of Python and PHP. I also have an MFA in Creative Writing (Fiction).

The projects here are just my hobby projects and are in various states of completion, so are only a glimpse of my code style.

- ðŸ”­ Personal projects Iâ€™m currently working on: 
  - Learning Rust 
  - Making a dotfiles/config manager in Tauri
  - Continuing to get better with React and Typescript
- ðŸŒŒ Things I'd like to build: 
  - A VSCode theme  
  - Sample/template websites for writers and animal rescues to use
  - A minimal yet rich text-editor for writers
  - Some plugins for Obsidian.md (an inventory tracker for DND is first on my list)
