# Live Long and Prosper :vulcan_salute:
I'm Danielle! I am a software developer with a passion for building accessible and well-designed applications. I'm mostly self-taught aside from a couple courses in grad school, and have otherwise learned on the job. HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS were my first languages back in the (gulp) late 90s (though, I have a hazy memory of learning some Basic in elementary school). I've since picked up C# and the .NET ecosystem, SQL, scrappy React and ES6, enough ColdFusion to make a mess of things, and sprinkles of Python and PHP. I also have an MFA in Creative Writing (Fiction).

The projects here are just my hobby projects and are in various states of completion, so are only a glimpse of my code style.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ðŸ’» Work projects: upgrading the voting system end to end, replacing our 10-years-past-EOL site search with a self-hosted Elasticsearch stack, transforming/importing old data into newer database, wiring up Prismic-backed Gatsby and Astro pages for our org, migrating .NET 4.8 apps to .NET 6, and assorted other technical debt
- ðŸ”­ Personal projects Iâ€™m currently working on: Learning Rust, playing with Astro.build, making an Alexa skill, and continuing to get better with React and Typescript
- ðŸŒŒ Things I'd like to build: sample/template websites for writers and animal rescues to use, a minimal yet rich text-editor for writers, some plugins for Obsidian.md
